Other positions and grips are possible but start with this standard position.\nPull the bar down until it's approximately level with the chin. Exhale on the downward motion. While shifting slightly backward is OK, aim to keep your upper torso stationary. Keep your feet flat on the floor and engage your abs as you pull. The bottom of the motion should be where your elbows can't move downward anymore without moving backward. Be sure to stop at that point and do not go lower.\nSqueeze the shoulder blades together while maintaining square shoulders.\nFrom the bottom position, with the bar close to your chin, slowly return the bar to the starting position while controlling its gradual ascent. Don't let it crash into the weight plates.",
